## Course Description

In this course, students will learn how to utilize a fresh, exciting new development paradigm that harnesses the power of peer-to-peer applications and distributed architectures. This course begins by demystifying common jargon in the modern-day blockchain ecosystem, then establishes best practices for developing consensus based products and services.

Students will learn how to write smart contracts, tokens, and other cryptographic assets using smart contracts written in Solidity --- quickly enabling each student to invent and produce the decentralized holdings of their dreams!

  - **_Plasma Path is optional._**

### Assignments

We will be using [Gradescope] this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through [Gradescope], and assignment and exam grades will be returned through [Gradescope]. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your [Gradescope] login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

## Course Description

In this course, students will learn how to utilize a fresh, exciting new development paradigm that harnesses the power of peer-to-peer applications and distributed architectures. This course begins by demystifying common jargon in the modern-day blockchain ecosystem, then establishes best practices for developing consensus based products and services.

Students will learn how to write smart contracts, tokens, and other cryptographic assets using smart contracts written in Solidity --- quickly enabling each student to invent and produce the decentralized holdings of their dreams!

## Learning Outcomes

**By the end of the course, you will be able to...**

1. Compare and contrast centralized and decentralized protocols, and determine the best use case for each technique.
1. Dive deeper into common decentralized protocols used daily by all developers.
1. Identify and describe different standards for token-based assets and their specific use cases on the blockchain.
1. Develop Smart Contracts and full-stack dApps using the Solidity protocol.
1. Speak professionally on the practical applications of decentralized applications and protocols.

## [**10m**] ☀️ Warm Up: Make Sure Environment is Set Up

In breakout rooms, double check that both you and your partner can successfully run `brownie compile` and `brownie run token` commands in the starter project from [last class](SmartContracts.md).

## [**20m**]  💻 Activity: Smart Contracts vs DApps

Watch [Difference between DApps and Smart Contracts? Programmer explains.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rczD8xKPJc) and answer the following questions:

1. In your notebook, **list everything you know** about **Smart Contracts** and **DApps**.
1. How are the two terms **similar**?
1. How are they **different**?

**When you're done, post your list on Slack in the `#bew2-4-dapps` channel.**

## [**10m**] 💬  Discuss: Smart Contracts vs DApps

Ask students to share answers and discuss.

## [**20m**] 💻 Activity: Architecture Distributions

Most projects require the following categories in order to be considered full stack applications:

1. Backend
1. Frontend
1. Data storage
1. Messaging / notification system
1. Name resolution

**Each** could be somewhat centralized or somewhat decentralized.

### Examples

- a frontend web app that runs on a centralized server, or a mobile app
- backend and data storage on private servers / proprietary databases, or you could use a smart contract and P2P storage

### Challenges

Discuss the answers to the following challenge questions in breakout rooms:

- Which of these categories are **commonly _decentralized_**?
- For each category, provide at least one example of each that occurs in real life...
    -  a _centralized_ example
    -  a _decentralized_ example


**When you're done, post your list on Slack in the `#bew2-4-dapps` channel.**

## [**30m**] 📚 TT: DApps

### History

> [!NOTE]
> Web 2.0 began when Web users started to drastically change the way they were using the Web on a day-to-day basis. The main trends that shaped Web 2.0 include content sharing, creativity, segmentation, social components, and a large move from static web sites and tools to more dynamic ones.

The creators of Ethereum had a grand vision --- one beyond smart contracts. They wanted to **invent a new web full of decentralized applications**, and **named this concept `web3`**.

### Key Terms

- **Smart Contracts** are a way to decentralize the controlling logic and payment functions of applications.
- **Web3 DApps**: are web applications that are mostly or completely decentralized. They decentralize all other aspects of an application: storage, messaging, naming, etc using smart contracts on the backend.

## [**02m**] 🏆 Objectives

1. Illustrate course progress using the DApps developer roadmap.
1. Install and configure a local Python environment suitable for writing DApps.
1. Compile your first smart contract using the Brownie framework.

## [**25m**] ☀️ Warm Up: DApp Developer Roadmap

Review the DApps developer roadmap with students.

![DApp Developer Roadmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecryptoshed/eth-dapp-developer-roadmap/master/dapp-developer-roadmap.png)

In breakout rooms (10 minutes), ask students to **identify where we are as a class on the roadmap**. When the breakout ends, use the remaining time to discuss and respond to student's answers.

## [**10m**] 📖 TT: Introduction to Brownie

Brownie is a **Python-based development and testing framework for smart contracts** targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

### Use Cases

- **Deployment**: Automate the deployment of many contracts onto the blockchain, and any transactions needed to initialize or integrate them.
- **Interaction**: Write scripts or use the console to interact with your contracts on the mainnet, or for quick testing in a local environment.
- **Debugging**: Get detailed information when a transaction reverts, to help you pinpoint the issue quickly.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests in python and evaluate test coverage based on stack trace analysis. We make no promises.

### Features

- Full support for [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) and [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper)
- Contract testing via [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), including trace-based coverage evaluation
- Property-based and stateful testing via [hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/tree/master/hypothesis-python)
- Powerful debugging tools, including python-style tracebacks and custom error strings
- Built-in console for quick project interaction
- Support for [ethPM](https://www.ethpm.com/) packages

## [**15m**] 💻 Activity: Install Brownie & Ganache

### Prerequisites

**_You only need to run these commands once per computer._**

1. You must have XCode installed, along with the command line tools. To install the XCode command line tools, run `xcode-select --install` in your Terminal.
1. Run `npm install -g ganache-cli` to install Ganache.

### Installation Guide

1. Create a folder for your first project, then `cd` into it.
1. Create a virtualenv inside the project folder: `python3 -m venv venv`.
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install the Brownie framework: `pip install eth-brownie`<br>_This might take a while!_
1. Run `brownie init --force` to create the initial project structure in your non-empty project directory.
1. Run `code .` or `atom .` to open the project directory in your IDE.
1. Run `brownie bake token`, then look at the project structure in your IDE. <br>_What happened inside your project directory after running_ `brownie bake token`?
1. Add `venv/` to the bottom of the autogenerated `.gitignore` file.
1. **Wait for further instruction.**

### Command List

```bash
$ mkdir first-token
$ cd first-token
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install eth-brownie
$ brownie init --force
$ brownie bake token
$ echo venv/ >>.gitignore
```

## [**10m**] 📖 TT: Project Structure

### Project Structure

Each Brownie project uses the following structure:

- `contracts/`: Contract sources
- `interfaces/`: Interface sources
- `scripts/`: Scripts for deployment and interaction
- `tests/`: Scripts for testing the project

The following directories are also created, and used internally by Brownie for managing the project.  **You should not edit or delete files within these folders.**

- `build/`: Project data such as compiler artifacts and unit test results
- `reports/`: JSON report files for use in the GUI

## [**15m**] 💻 Activity: Common Brownie Commands

**In the project you just created, run:**

```bash
brownie console
```

**Discuss and write down the answers to following questions**:

- Have you seen similar consoles in the past?
- What is the purpose of this console?
- How to you exit this console?

**After exiting the console, run this command:**

```bash
brownie compile
```

**What did this command do? Why is it important?**


## [**10m**] 📖 TT: Introduction to the Console

Brownie’s console provides a simple way to perform on-the-fly testing and debugging, as well as interacting with contracts on a local or remote blockchain.

Check out this quick video for an example of the console's functionality:

## [**20m**] 💡Tutorial: Your First Token (Part 1 of 2)

In a brand new folder, complete the steps described in [Getting Started With Brownie (1 of 2)](https://medium.com/better-programming/getting-started-with-brownie-part-2-615a1eec167f), which will **walk you through creating your first token** using the Brownie framework.

If you finish this section early, assist others in your breakout room


## [**05m**] 💬 Check In: Tutorial Q&A (Part 1 of 2)

Instructor will answer student questions in the main room before dismissing to work on the second half of the tutorial.

## [**20m**] 💡Tutorial: Your First Token (Part 2 of 2)

In the same folder, complete the steps described in [Getting Started With Brownie (2 of 2)](https://medium.com/better-programming/getting-started-with-brownie-part-3-ef6bfa9867d7), which will walk you through **interacting with your first token** using the Brownie framework.

## [**05m**] 💬 Check In: Tutorial Q&A (Part 2 of 2)

Instructor will answer student questions in the main room before dismissing students for the day.

## [**03m**] 🌃 After Class: Read the Docs

- **When you've completed the tutorial, push your code to a new GitHub repository, then submit your repo on Gradescope under the assignment named [[Day 7] Your First Token](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/160564/assignments/661918).**

- **Spend at least `30 minutes` reviewing the [Brownie Documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#features).** Get familiar with the features. Be sure to write down any questions you have so we can discuss them together during the next class!

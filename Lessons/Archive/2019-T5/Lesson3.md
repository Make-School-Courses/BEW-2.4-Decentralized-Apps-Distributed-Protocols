## Learning Objectives (5 Minutes)

1. Introduce the components of a Solidity Smart Contract.
2. Define the syntax used when implementing a Solidity smart contract.
3. Practice smart contract theory by commenting an existing smart contract codebase.

## Initial Exercise (20 Minutes)

Answer the warm up questions below on mini-whiteboards.

*You may answer the questions solo or in a pair.*

1. **Challenge 1**: What is the difference between *Ether* and *Etherium*?
2. **Challenge 2**: What is an *unsigned integer*?
3. **Challenge 3**: What is *Natspec*? How is it used? Write out an example using an unsigned integer!

## TT (30 Minutes)

Go over the syntax and anatomy of an Etherium smart contract using the line-by-line comments [available here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/).

## BREAK (10 Minutes)

## In Class Activity I (40 Minutes)

1. Find a partner.
2. Fill in as many blanks as you can together **WITHOUT** your laptops open.
3. Show the instructor when you've filled in everything you remember from today's lecture.
4. The instructor will then provide you with a link where you can check your work and fill in any missing blanks on the worksheet!

## Wrap Up / After Class

Continue working on the CryptoZombies tutorial!

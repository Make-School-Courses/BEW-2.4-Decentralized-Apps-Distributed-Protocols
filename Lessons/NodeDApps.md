## 🏆 **02m**: Learning Objectives

1. Analyze the full-stack ecosystem that enables the development of smart contracts and distributed applications in Node.
2. Identify and leverage existing boilerplate applications to establish a strong initial foundation in projects.
3. Begin proposing, designing, and planning your own token based coin using the Truffle framework!

## 🤔 **03m**: Why You Should Know This

Frameworks boost programmer productivity by initializing a standards-based foundation with which to develop a product.

Truffle Suite provides the scaffolding to our projects, similar to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [Django](https://djangoproject.com).


## ☀️ **20m**: Warm Up

Answer the warm up questions below in breakout rooms:

*You may answer the questions solo or in a pair.*

1. **Challenge 1**: What is the difference between *Ether* and *Ethereum*?
2. **Challenge 2**: What is an *unsigned integer*?
3. **Challenge 3**: What is *Natspec*? How is it used? Write out an example using an unsigned integer!

## 📖 **30m**: Overview

A **world class development environment**, **testing framework**, and **asset pipeline** for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.

### Truffle Features

- Built-in **smart contract compilation**, **linking**, **deployment** and **binary management**.
- **Automated contract testing** for rapid development.
- **Scriptable, extensible deployment** and **migrations** framework.
- **Network management**: deploy to any number of public and private networks.
- **Package management** via `ethpm` and `npm`, using the `ERC190` standard.
- **Interactive console** for direct contract communication.
- **Configurable build pipeline** with support for tight integration.
- **External script runner** that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

### Ganache Features

Ganache is a **personal blockchain for Ethereum development** you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.

It is available as **both a desktop application** as well as a **command-line too**l *(formerly known as the TestRPC)*.

Drizzle is a **collection of front-end libraries that make writing dapp front-ends easier and more predictable**.

Takes care of synchronizing contract data, transaction data, and more. Things stay fast because you declare what to keep in sync.

OpenZeppelin is a library for secure smart contract development. It provides implementations of standards like ERC20 and ERC721 which you can deploy as-is or extend to suit your needs, as well as Solidity components to build custom contracts and more complex decentralized systems.

### OpenZeppelin Features

- **Focused on Security**: Using industry standard contract security patterns and best practices, develop applications with reduced risk of vulnerabilities using standard, tested, community-reviewed code.
- **Compatibility**: Runs on any EVM-compatible blockchain.
- **Modular Approach**: Simple code, only basics. Easy collaboration and auditing.
- **Open Source**: Community driven. Used by multiple organizations and individuals.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

### Guidelines

- You can work **solo** or **in pairs** with another student.
- You may partner with students in other sections of this course.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- **Proof of Props**: `ERC20` token that represents a moment of gratitude shared between two people.
- **Coder Cards**: `ERC721`  token that represents a card in trading card game for software engineers. Card rarity determined by GitHub profile statistics (# of stars, # of repos, # of closed issues, etc)
- **Voting**: Create a DApp for voting where all of the votes and candidate registration happens on chain.
  - Allow anyone to start an election with a registration period, voting period, and ending time.
  - Allow anyone to sign up as a candidate during the registration period.
  - Allow anyone to vote once during the voting period.
  - Create a front end where voters can see the results and know how long is left in the election.
- **Santa's List**: Create a user tracking DApp.
  - Build a system for tracking who is on their nice list and who is on their naughty list.
  - Allow for people to pay a fee to get themselves off of the naughty list.
  - Let users on the nice list earn a portion of the fees based on how many other people are on the nice list.
- **Advertisement Auction**: Create an image + text area on a website and button under it which make a call to Ethereum. Make a function allowing anyone to pay more ETH than the last person in order to change the text and image link on the website.
- **Cheese Touch**: Create a non-fungible token dapp for a token that no one wants to have, a cheese touch token.
  - Allow only 1 token to be 'live' at a time; if there is no live token anyone can create one.
  - Allow users to transfer the live token to anyone else.
  - If any user holds a live token for more than 24 hours then they can no longer transfer it, and the token should no longer be live.



## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deliverables

> [!DANGER]
> Both deliverables must be submitted to pass the project.

### Code

Your codebase must be submitted on [Gradescope] no later than **Friday, October 9**<sup>th</sup> @ **11:59PM PST**.

### Demo

On the last day of the course, each team is required to present a **pre-recorded demonstration** (`2 - 5 mins`) of their √êApp.

   - **Opportunities** you discovered
   - **Challenges** you faced
   - **Next steps** for the project
   - Each partner writes a **custom shoutout** for one another
